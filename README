SliTaz Doc
===============================================================================


This package provides SliTaz documentation installed on the system by default. 
With the cooking version we just provide some basic information and the
Handbook and with the stable version we also provide the Release Notes.

Desktop files are also provided to have a menu entry and an icon on the users 
desktop.


Handbook
--------
The story started with a nice and static Handbook, translated by greate
contributors from all over the world but one day the project decided
to put all documentation on a wiki site. It was not a so good idea, no
change in the handbook and no more static and packagable documentation as
well as any real official reference documentation.

So in spring 2012, Claudinei asked Pankso if a new handbook would be fine.
The anser was more than positive and the repo was created. The goal is
to have a official documentation, unmodified by anonymous users, in pure
HTML so it can be packages with a date string as version.

We use this repos for collaboration and the mailing list.
