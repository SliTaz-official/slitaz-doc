<a name="hardware"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Supported Hardware</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz GNU/Linux supports all machines based on the i486 or x86 Intel compatible
processors. A minimum 192MB of memory is recommended to use the core LiveCD. 
64MB is needed for the "slitaz-loram" flavor and 16MB for the 
"slitaz-loram-cdrom" flavor.
</p>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 provides all needed drivers and tools such as 915resolution to
have support for a wide range of netbooks (Eeepc, HP mini, Aspire One, etc).
</p>

<p>
The slitaz-loram flavor allows to graphically install SliTaz on very old machines with constrained resources.
The liveCD may be less responsive, but once installed, SliTaz works
well with a minimum of 16MB memory. On very old machines, you may be better off
using a text based browser such as 'links'.  
</p>


<a name="livecd"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">LiveCD Flavors</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz GNU/Linux is distributed as a bootable LiveCD. You can use the LiveCD as a normal system or you can 
graphically install Slitaz to the hard drive. Installing/upgrading Slitaz retains your previous system's settings, applications and documents. 
</p>
<p>
The LiveCD can also be customised and easily rebuilt both graphically or from
the command line. Install your own custom set of packages, or simply use one
of the preset flavors on the mirror. Then simply generate your distribution 
with the "Tazlito" tool.
</p>

<a name="toolchain"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Kernel and toolchain</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 comes with a new but very well tested 2.6.30.6 Linux kernel and a complete new
build toolchain from which the whole system has been built. The 2.6.30.6 Linux kernel is 
separated into several linux-packages for supporting additional drivers and features. This time
we have also built-in some more drivers to have a faster kernel boot.
</p>
<p>
The new toolchain comprises of: Binutils 2.19.1, GCC 4.4.1, Glibc 2.10.1
</p>

<a name="utf-8"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">UTF-8 support</font></h3>
With this release, Slitaz community can enjoy full UTF-8 support.
It uses standard PO files for the translation of all SliTaz related tools, boxes and utilities.
With better internationalization support (russian, portuguese, chinese, arabic and many more), 
contributors can now use graphical tools such as poedit to make translations using GNU gettext standards. 
The labs also have a i18n project to easily upload files to be included in the distribution. 
The locale packs have more translated application(s) messages for the core system and 
some extra packages for applications such as Gimp, Abiword, Gnumeric, etc.

<a name="xorg"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Xorg server</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz now uses the Xorg X window system. With the tazx utility, you can reconfigure Xorg and 
select the correct driver for your card. The xorg server comes with the vesa 
driver by default which powers most cards. However, if you install some of the
other xorg video drivers, you may need to manually configure your xorg.conf.
We also hope that our growing community would be able to provide and support an official Xvesa flavor.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">HD install and LiveUSB</font></h3>
<p>
The installation is fully automated and can be done graphically or in text
mode. The slitaz installer now lets you use a separate partition for
/home, configure the root password and chose the default user login. The installer also
now supports installation from a LiveUSB session.
</p>
<!--<p>
Full USB install is also supported and some time is needed using <code>rootdelay=10</code>
as a kernel argument (in GRUB menu.lst).
</p>-->

<a name="packages"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Software Packages</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 has 2291 packages in the database. A wide variety of packages
have been commited. 
Tazpkg package manager also supports converting deb/rpm/arch/slackware/ipk packages to Slitaz native format
A lot of time was also spent maintaining many professionnal grade software such as OpenERP, MySQL, GLPI.
</p>
<p>
On the update side, mostly all the packages have been updated, including
the kernel, the toolchain, Xorg (7.4), GTK and QT. Package format has
also changed to support lzma for better compression and faster package downloads.
Packages are also checked by Tazwok to ensure the FHS is followed. Packages are now built 
automatically by the SliTaz Build Bot: <a href="http://bb.slitaz.org/">bb.slitaz.org</a>
</p>

<a name="desktop"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Core Desktop</font></h3>
<p>
A lot of attention has been paid the the core desktop. All applications
are well integrated and a special SliTaz theme (icons, Openbox, GTK) has
been created.
</p>
<p>
The core desktop provides a selection of multi-use packages for surfing the
web, listening to music, audio editing, image manipulation and developing or 
burning to optical media. One click application menu helps to find installed software by categories.
</p>


<a name="security"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Security</font></h3>
<p>
Slitaz is more secured and robust now. Firewall rules have been updated. A firewall can be installed using graphical tazhw box. 
The serverbox can help to maintain the installed firewall. 
Mountbox can manage crypto device with devmapper. Mountbox packages dependencies: dmsetup linux-md devmapper.
Crypt setup tools allow encryption of block devices.
</p>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">From 2.0 to 3.0</font></h3>
<p>
The SliTaz GNU/linux installer offers an update function allowing you to
upgrade from a '2.0' to '3.0' version. To upgrade the system you first
need to boot the 'Stable' LiveCD, launch the installer, select upgrade and then
specify the partition containing the system that you want to update. The
installer will then clean out the system and reinstall all the packages not
present on the CD from the mirror. When this has finished you can reboot
with your new version of SliTaz.
</p>
<p>
Note that the installer will keep a copy of the list of packages and a complete
archive of the /etc directory (etc.tar.gz) in /var/lib/slitaz-install.
</p>
<p>
To upgrade a 2.0 to 3.0 it is also possible to use the package manager "Tazpkg" 
via the 'set-release' function, but beware this is not yet proven and may 
require some manual intervention. If you choose this method you must first
install 'tazpkg' from 3.0, because the package format has changed.
</p>
