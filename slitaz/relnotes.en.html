<h3>Toolchain and build tools</h3>
<p>
	Slitaz 4.0 has been built with our new build tools aka cookutils. We
	have created new tools which handle the ~3300 packages dependencies 
	in a simple and consistent way. The cookutils let you also create new 
	Slitaz packages faster than ever. The tools are installed on each 
	SliTaz system as well as any supporting documentation.
</p>

<h3>Supported Hardware</h3>
<p>
	SliTaz GNU/Linux 4.0 supports most machines based on i486 or x86 Intel
	compatible processors. A minimum of 192MB of memory is recommended to
	use the core LiveCD and our new russian dolls system will automatically
	detect your memory to boot a low memory resource flavor if needed. The 
	default LiveCD provides the Core system which is a fully featured desktop,
	a GTK only desktop, a flavor with just X windows and a text mode 
	system which will run with only 48 MB RAM (but can still let you 
	install a full desktop).
</p>


<h3>Live systems</h3>
<p>
	SliTaz 4.0 core LiveCD provides in fact 4 versions and will use the one 
	your hardware can support. The live CD holds several SliTaz nested subsets.
	The boot loader selects the most features that your computer memory can 
	access. You can also select an image from the menu and hit [tab] to edit
	any options. A command line, the ability to webboot, help options and
	languages are also available from the menu. Now people with very little
	RAM can boot the Live CD, but probably in text mode. A full install can
	now be performed to hard disk directly from the Live CD using text mode
	with only 48MB ram.
</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
	The installation is fully automated and can be done graphically or in
	text mode. Tazinst is a lightweight SliTaz HDD installer. It installs
	SliTaz to a hard drive from a Live-CD, a LiveUSB key, a SliTaz
	ISO image, or from the web (using Tazpanel) by downloading a stable,
	cooking or rolling version. The prerequisite material and other useful
	information can be found in the Manual and Handbook.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to partition a disk before installation, you can quickly
	use Gparted in LiveCD mode or use a flavor containing the partitioning
	tool. At the end of the installation it is possible to setup the "GRUB"
	bootloader which is capable of starting almost any operating system.
	This allows SliTaz to co-exist with a previously installed operating
	system, such as Windows. 
</p>


<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>
	Among the 3350 packages available in SliTaz 4.0 you will find anything you
	need to transform your machine to a complete graphical desktop (e17), a
	graphics studio with The Gimp or Inkscape, or to a video editor with Kino.
	You can experience the world wide web with instant messaging, VOIP, email
	and of course through a web browser. Packages can be found through the
	search function of Tazpkg, Tazpanel or via the website: 
	<a href="http://pkgs.slitaz.org/" target="_blank">http://pkgs.slitaz.org/</a>
</p>
<p>
	SliTaz is designed to function as a powerful web server, using the stable
	LightTPD/PHP package (not installed by default), supporting CGI, Perl
	and Python. Apache and Squid are also available. The ability to browse
	the web securely using the Tor network is also supported.
</p>
<p>
	SliTaz can of course also provide a complete development environment with
	the GCC compiler, Geany IDE, Mercurial Repositories and all development 
	libraries. 
</p>
<p>
	Packages are now built automatically by the SliTaz Build Bot: 
	<a href="http://cook.slitaz.org/" target="_blank">http://cook.slitaz.org/</a> and are checked
	by Cookutils to ensure that FHS standards are followed.
</p>

<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>
	The new way and tool to configure the system on SliTaz 4.0 is TazPanel.
	It is a CGI/web interface with a themable user interface from where
	you can control your entire system such as package management, adding
	or removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Each page
	provides a small description to help you manage your SliTaz system.
	To access the panel you can use the menu entry in “System Tools” or
	this url: <a href="http://tazpanel:82" target="_blank">http://tazpanel:82</a>
</p>

<h3>Core Desktop</h3>
<p>
	A lot of attention has been paid the the core desktop. All applications
	are well integrated and a special SliTaz theme (including icons, Openbox,
	GTK) has been created.
</p>
<p>
	By default, the SliTaz LiveCD uses the very light and stable Openbox
	window manager. Openbox is widely themeable and configurable using the
	ObConf utility. The integration of the taskbar “LXpanel” makes it
	possible to dynamically provide a menu based on the Freedesktop
	standards. The principle is to have a small menu accessible via a
	screen click with the favorites, windows effects, LiveCD and LiveUSB 
	tools, Openbox configuration and system actions made available. Applications
	can also be accessed through the menu supplied by LXpanel. The managment
	of the Desktop and icons are entrusted to the file manager PCmanFM.
</p>
<p>
	Through the support of a LiveCD flavor or an installed system you can
	install the Enlightenment (e17) desktop environment or the window
	managers XFCE, Pekwm, JWM and DWM. The different sessions can be
	selected via the F1 key when using the “Slim” login window. To change
	the default session you can use tazx; or manually edit the
	~/.Xinitrc file. 
</p>

<h3>SliTaz network</h3>
<p>
	All services have been changed and improved since 3.0 and a SliTaz
	community network has been created to help users, contributors and 
	developers come together to share ideas about the project.
	This includes a community board, wiki based documentation, a forum 
	and a bug tracker. Now developers, artists, documentation writers, 
	bug reporters and anybody with a good suggestion can help others, 
	get involved and work together to improve the project. The SliTaz 
	community network (SCN), website and repos all combine the same 
	graphical layout for easy navigation.
</p>

<h3>From 3.0 to 4.0</h3>
<p>
	A SliTaz GNU/Linux installer offers an update function allowing you 
	to upgrade from a 3.0 to 4.0 version. To upgrade the system you 
	first need to boot the Stable LiveCD, launch the installer from the 
	command line or Tazpanel, select upgrade and then specify the 
	partition or configuration file containing the system that you want 
	to update. The installer will then clean out the system and reinstall
	all the packages not present on the CD from the mirror. When this has 
	finished you can reboot with your new version of SliTaz.
</p>
<p>
	To upgrade a 3.0 to 4.0 it is also possible to use the package manager Tazpkg
	via the set-release function, but beware this is not yet proven and may 
	require some manual intervention.
</p>

<h3>People of the Project</h3>
<p>

	the project are the ones who develop the distribution, correct the website,
	develop the HG repositories and write the official documentation. Passing
