</p>

<a name="hardware"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Supported Hardware</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz GNU/Linux supports all machines based on the i486 or x86 Intel compatible
processors. A minimum 192MB of memory is recommended to use the core LiveCD. 
80MB is needed for the "slitaz-loram" flavor and 16MB for the 
"slitaz-loram-cdrom" flavor.
</p>
<p>
With the slitaz-loram flavor, the system is less responsive, but allows you to
graphically install SliTaz on very old machines with limited resources. Once installed, SliTaz works
well with a minimum of 16MB memory, but forget about using Firefox to surf the
web - you'll have to use the text based 'links' for example. 
</p>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 provides all needed drivers and tools such as 915resolution to
have support for a wide range of netbooks (Eeepc, HP mini, Aspire One, etc).
</p>

<a name="livecd"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">LiveCD Flavors</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz GNU/Linux is distributed as a bootable LiveCD. You can use the LiveCD 
as a normal system or you can graphically install Slitaz to the hard drive. 
Installing/upgrading Slitaz retains your previous system's settings, applications
and documents. 
</p>
<p>
The LiveCD can also be customised and easily rebuilt both graphically or from
the command line. Install your own custom set of packages, or simply use one
of the preset flavors on the mirror. Then simply generate your distribution 
with the "Tazlito" tool.
</p>
<p>
The ISO image now uses a 'hybrid' system: it can also be copied onto an USB stick 
without formating it (using <code>dd</code>).
</p>

<a name="toolchain"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Kernel and toolchain</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 comes with a new but very well tested 2.6.30.6 Linux kernel and a complete new
build toolchain from which the whole system has been built. The 2.6.30.6 Linux kernel is 
separated into several linux-packages for supporting additional drivers and features. This time
we have also built-in some more drivers to have a faster kernel boot.
</p>
<p>
The new toolchain comprises of: Binutils 2.19.1, GCC 4.4.1, Glibc 2.10.1
</p>

<a name="utf-8"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">UTF-8 support</font></h3>
With this release, the Slitaz community can enjoy full UTF-8 support.
SliTaz uses standard PO files for the translation of all SliTaz related tools, boxes and utilities.
With better internationalization support (russian, portuguese, chinese, and many more), 
contributors can now use graphical tools such as poedit to make translations using GNU gettext standards. 
The labs also have an i18n project to easily upload files to be included in the distribution. 
The locale packs have more translated application messages for the core system and 
some extra packages for applications such as Gimp, Abiword, Gnumeric, etc.

<a name="xorg"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Xorg server</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz now uses the Xorg X window system (although we will always try to 
provide a Xvesa flavor). With the tazx utility you can reconfigure Xorg and 
select the correct driver for your card. The xorg server comes with the vesa 
driver by default which powers most cards; although you may still need to 
manually configure your xorg.conf to some degree if you install some of the
other drivers.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">HD install and LiveUSB</font></h3>
<p>
The installation is fully automated and can be done graphically or in text
mode. The slitaz installer now lets you use a separate partition for
/home, configure the root password and chose the default user login. 
The installer also now supports installation from a LiveUSB session.
</p>
<p>
Full USB install is also supported using <code>rootdelay=10</code>
as a kernel argument (in GRUB menu.lst). The root delay ensures the Kernel
has detected the device before mounting it on / (root).
</p>

<a name="packages"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Software Packages</font></h3>
<p>
SliTaz 3.0 has around 2300 packages in the database. A wide variety of packages
have been commited and the Tazpkg package manager can now convert
deb/rpm/arch/slackware/ipk packages to Slitaz native format (.tazpkg).
A lot of time was also spent maintaining professional grade software
such as OpenERP, MySQL, GLPI.
</p>
<p>
On the update side, mostly all the packages have been updated, including
the kernel, toolchain, Xorg (7.4), GTK and QT. The package format has
also changed to support lzma for better compression and faster 
downloads. Packages are also checked by Tazwok to ensure the FHS is followed
and packages are now built automatically by the SliTaz Build Bot: 
<a href="http://bb.slitaz.org/">bb.slitaz.org</a>
</p>

<a name="desktop"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Core Desktop</font></h3>
<p>
A lot of attention has been paid the the core desktop. All applications
are well integrated and a special SliTaz theme (icons, Openbox, GTK) has
been created.
</p>
<p>
The core desktop provides a selection of multi-use packages for surfing the
web, listening to music, audio editing, image manipulation and developing or 
burning to optical media. It's just one click in the application menu to find 
installed software by category.
</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">Security</font></h3>
<p>
Slitaz is more secure and robust now and the firewall rules have been updated. A
firewall can be installed using the graphical tazhw box, and serverbox can help
to maintain the installed firewall. Mountbox can manage crypto devices with
devmapper and the crypt setup tools allow encryption of block devices.
</p>

<a name="upgrade"></a>
<h3><font color="#6c0023">From 2.0 to 3.0</font></h3>
<p>
The SliTaz GNU/linux installer offers an update function allowing you to
upgrade from a '2.0' to '3.0' version. To upgrade the system you first
need to boot the 'Stable' LiveCD, launch the installer, select upgrade and then
specify the partition containing the system that you want to update. The
installer will then clean out the system and reinstall all the packages not
present on the CD from the mirror. When this has finished you can reboot
with your new version of SliTaz.
</p>
<p>
Note that the installer will keep a copy of the list of packages and a complete
archive of the /etc directory (etc.tar.gz) in /var/lib/slitaz-install.
</p>
<p>
To upgrade a 2.0 to 3.0 it is also possible to use the package manager "Tazpkg" 
via the 'set-release' function, but beware this is not yet proven and may 
require some manual intervention. If you choose this method you must first
install 'tazpkg' from 3.0, because the package format has changed.
</p>
