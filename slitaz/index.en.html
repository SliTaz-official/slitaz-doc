<h2 id="start">Getting started</h2>


<h3 id="tazpanel">SliTaz Panel</h3>
<p>
	From spring 2011 the new way (and tool) to configure the system is TazPanel.
	It is a CGI/web interface with a themable user interface from where you
	can control your entire system, this includes package management, adding or
	removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Each page provides
	a small description to help you manage your SliTaz system. To access the
	panel you can use the menu entry in “System Tools” or this URL:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://tazpanel:82">http://tazpanel:82</a>
</p>
<p>
	While some actions in the panel are available to the user, others require
	administrator rights. On the right side of the TazPanel menu you can find
	an icon, prompting the current operating mode:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#859900"></span> for user mode;</li>
	<li><span style="color:#cb4b16"></span> for administration mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Please point the mouse cursor over the icon to show more information; then click the icon
	to log into TazPanel as a different user or as root administrator.
</p>



<h3 id="network">Network connections</h3>

<p>
	Open Tazpanel and click the “Network” →
	“<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi">Summary</a>” menu entry.
	This shows a basic overview of your networking interfaces and their states.
</p>
<p>
	To configure your Ethernet device, click the “Network” →
	“<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi?eth">Ethernet</a>”.
	From here you can configure (with administrator privileges) your device
	to use DHCP or a static address.
</p>
<p>
	To configure Wireless devices, click the “Network” →
	“<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi?wifi">Wireless</a>”.
	Here you can select a network to connect to (with administrator privileges).
	When you click on the desired network, the Connection box underneath will be
	appropriately filled in.
	Next, enter your passphrase or leave the field blank for none.
	Finally, click the Configure button to apply settings.
</p>
<p>
	More detailed information can be found in the Handbook:
	<a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:networkconf">Network configuration</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="apps">Applications</h3>

<p>
To have a list of all graphical applications, you can use the SliTaz menu button 
at the top left of the screen. To have a list of command line tools, you
can open a terminal and double press on the tabulation button.
</p>
<p>
Tazpanel provides 
a nice GUI for package management through the 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/pkgs.cgi">Packages</a> tab. To retrieve a list of all 
installed packages, open Tazpanel and navigate to the 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/pkgs.cgi?list">My Packages</a> page.
</p>
<p>
To install new 
packages, you must have a network connection, the DVD of packages or a USB storage
device containing any downloaded packages.  Naturally any package management
can also be done from the command line using <code>tazpkg</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another option to query the packages database online is to use
<a href="http://pkgs.slitaz.org/">pkgs.slitaz.org</a> in a graphical web browser
on any of your devices. You can see screenshots of applications and even install
or remove a package if the site is opened in SliTaz.
</p>


<h3 id="office">Office suite</h3>

<p>
The SliTaz packages database provides a variety of lightweight office applications.
All of these packages are easily installable in a few clicks through the packages
manager in Tazpanel. SliTaz also provides a simple way to install the powerful
LibreOffice suite: just search for “LibreOffice” in the packages manager, click
on “get-LibreOffice”, and click Install (to install and remove packages you
need administrator privileges).
</p>
<p>
To have a lightweight office suite: just use
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=abiword">Abiword</a>
as the Word processor,
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=gnumeric">Gnumeric</a>
as a spreadsheet and
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=homebank">Homebank</a>
for Bank Accounting.
</p>


<h3 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h3>

<p>
Most SliTaz flavors include a wide range of sound card drivers, a volume
mixer and a light audio player to easily listen to any MP3 or OGG files. The Sound
card is autodetected at boot time and audio support works out-of-the-box
on many systems. If you manually add a new user and can't listen to audio, please
check that the user belongs to the <code>audio</code> group. For any other trouble, please
check the full documentation and/or use the <a href="http://forum.slitaz.org/">forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
Videos using common HTML5 codecs such as WEBM or MPEG4 can be watched out-of-the-box.
Other videos can be watched by installing one single package or using a dedicated
LiveCD or LiveUSB system. The SliTaz team have packaged some of the best video players 
available under GNU/Linux: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=mplayer">MPlayer</a>,
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=xine-ui">Xine-UI</a> and
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:82/user/pkgs.cgi?info=vlc">VLC</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="root">Becoming Root</h3>

<p>
By default, SliTaz doesn't have its desktop running as root administrator:
it asks for a root password (default <code>root</code>) for any superuser work.
Therefore, it is safer and more secure.
</p>
<p>
To become root in an xterm, simply type <code>su</code> and enter the root password.
To run a graphical application as root, use <code>subox</code>.
For example, to run leafpad as root you would run <code>subox leafpad</code>.
</p>


<h3 id="install">Installation</h3>

<p>
SliTaz can be installed to a hard disk or on an USB mass storage device using the
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/installer.cgi">SliTaz Installer</a> in Tazpanel.
The installer makes a full HD install.
SliTaz won't function in memory (RAM) anymore like in Live or Frugal mode and 
everything is persistent.
</p>
<p>
To generate a LiveUSB system, you can use the “Tazusb LiveUSB Tool” from 
the “System Tools” menu or <code>tazusb</code> from the command line. More 
information can be found in the SliTaz Handbook:
<a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:liveusb">LiveUSB media</a>.
