<h2>Getting started</h2>

<a name="tazpanel"></a>
<h3>SliTaz Panel</h3>
<p>
	From spring 2011 the new way (and tool) to configure the system is TazPanel.
	It is a CGI/web interface with a themable user interface from where you
	can control your entire system, this includes package management, adding or
	removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Each page provides
	a small description to help you manage your SliTaz system. To access the
	panel you can use the menu entry in "System Tools" or this url:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://tazpanel:82">http://tazpanel:82</a>
</p>

<a name="network"></a>
<h3>Network connections</h3>
<p>
Open Tazpanel and go to the 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi">Network</a>
 tab.
This shows a basic overview of your networking interfaces and their states.  To configure
your Ethernet device, mouse over the Network tab and select 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi?eth">Ethernet</a>
.  From here you
can configure your device to use DHCP or a static address.  To configure Wireless devices,
mouse over the Network tab and select 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/network.cgi?wifi">Wireless</a>.
  Here you can select a network to connect to.
When you click on the desired network, the Connection box underneath will be appropriately
filled in.  Next, enter your passphrase or leave the field blank for none.  Finally,
click the Configure button to apply settings.
</p>
<p>
More detailed information can be found in the Handbook: 
<a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:networkconf"
	>Network configuration</a>
</p>

<a name="apps"></a>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
To have a list of all graphical applications, you can use the SliTaz menu button 
at the bottom left of the screen. To have a list of command line tools, you
can open a terminal and double press on the tabulation button.  Tazpanel provides 
a nice GUI for package management through the 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/pkgs.cgi">Packages</a> tab. To retrieve a list of all 
installed packages, open Tazpanel and navigate to the 
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/pkgs.cgi?list">My Packages</a> page.  To install new 
packages, you must have a network connection, the DVD of packages or a USB storage
device containing any downloaded packages.  Naturally any package management
can also be done from the command line using <code>tazpkg</code>.
</p>

<a name="office"></a>
<h3>Office suite</h3>
<p>
The SliTaz packages database provides a variety of lightweight office applications.
All of these packages are easily installable in a few clicks through the packages
manager in Tazpanel. SliTaz also provides a simple way to install the powerful
LibreOffice suite: just search for "LibreOffice" in the packages manager, double click
on "get-LibreOffice", select the "Auto install non free package" checkbox, and click
Install.
</p>
<p>
To have a lightweight office suite: just use Abiword as the Word processor, Gnumeric as a
Spreadsheet and Homebank for Bank Accounting.
</p>

<a name="multimedia"></a>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<p>
Most SliTaz flavors include a wide range of sound card drivers, a volume
mixer and a light audio player to easily listen to any MP3 or OGG files. The Sound
card is autodetected at boot time and audio support works out-of-the-box
on many systems. If you manually add a new user and can't listen to audio, please
check that the user belongs to the <code>audio</code> group. For any other trouble, please
check the full documentation and/or use the forum.
</p>
<p>
Videos can be watched by installing one single package or using a dedicated
LiveCD or LiveUSB system. The SliTaz team have packaged some of the best video players 
available under GNU/Linux: <code>mplayer</code>, <code>xine-ui</code> and <code>vlc</code>.
</p>

<a name="info"></a>
<h3>System information</h3>
<p>
You can get information on your system by clicking on "System information"
in the System Tools menu, then "Summary". Clicking on the other 
buttons offers you more information, and using the benchmarks can
give you an idea on how fast your computer is. To have a list and control
of all your current processes, you can use the "Task Manager" available in
the same menu.
</p>

<a name="root"></a>
<h3>Becoming Root</h3>
<p>
By default, Slitaz doesn't have its desktop running as root administrator:
it asks for a root password (default <code>root</code>) for any superuser work.
Therefore, it is safer and more secure. To become root in an xterm, simply 
type <code>su</code> and enter the root password.  To run a graphical application
as root, use <code>subox</code>.  For example, to run leafpad as root you
would run <code>subox leafpad</code>.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
SliTaz can be installed to a hard disk or on an USB mass storage device using the
<a href="http://tazpanel:82/installer.cgi">SliTaz Installer</a> in Tazpanel. The installer makes a full HD install.
SliTaz won't function in memory (RAM) anymore like in Live or Frugal mode and 
everything is persistent.
</p>
<p>
To generate a LiveUSB system, you can use the "Tazusb LiveUSB Tool" from the "System Tools"
menu or <code>tazusb</code> from the command line. More information can be found in the SliTaz
Handbook: <a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:liveusb">LiveUSB media</a>
