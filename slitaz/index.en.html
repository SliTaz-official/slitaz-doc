<h2>Getting started</h2>

<a name="tazpanel"></a>
<h3>SliTaz Panel</h3>
<p>
	From spring 2011 the new way (and tool) to configure the system is TazPanel.
	It is a CGI/web interface with a themable user interface from where you
	can control your entire system such as package management, adding or
	removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Each page provides
	a small description to help you manage your SliTaz system. To access the
	panel you can use the menu entry in "System Tools" or this url:
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://tazpanel:82">http://tazpanel:82</a>
</p>

<a name="network"></a>
<h3>Network connections</h3>
<p>
Click on the "Network Status Monitor" at the bottom right of the screen, then
"Configure" and the network manager (netbox) will come up. You can then
go to the "DHCP" tab and click "Start", and Slitaz will send a DHCP request 
to the local router. You may also setup a static IP, PPPoE, PPP, VPN and 
other networking options by using their respective tabs. To configure a wireless 
connection, you can use SliTaz wifibox by clicking "Wireless Manager" in the 
Network Manager or by using the "System Tools" menu entry -> "Wireless networks 
connections".
</p>
<p>
More detailed information can be found in the Handbook: 
<a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:networkconf"
	>Network configuration</a>
</p>

<a name="apps"></a>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
To have a list of all graphical applications, you can use the SliTaz menu button 
at the bottom left of the screen. To have a list of command line tools, you
can open a terminal and double press on the tabulation button. And to have
a list of all installed packages, you can launch the package manager user interface
from the Lxpanel icon or by using the "System Tools" menu entry. To install any new packages,
you must have a network connection, the DVD of packages or an USB storage device 
containing any downloaded packages. Naturally any package management
can also be done from the command line and <code>tazpkg</code>.
</p>

<a name="office"></a>
<h3>Office suite</h3>
<p>
The SliTaz packages database provides some lightweight office applications.
All of these packages are easily installable in a few clicks through the packages
manager. SliTaz also provides a simple way to install the powerful
OpenOffice suite: just search for "OpenOffice" in the packages manager, double click
on "get-OpenOffice3" and install the script with the <code>Auto exec</code> option
enabled. 
</p>
<p>
To have a lightweight office suite: just use Abiword for the Word processor, Gnumeric as a
Spreadsheet and Homebank for Bank Accounting.
</p>

<a name="multimedia"></a>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<p>
Most SliTaz flavors include a wide range of sound card drivers, a volume
mixer and a light audio player to easily listen to any MP3 or OGG files. The Sound
card is autodetected at boot time and audio support works out-of-the-box
on many systems. If you manually add a new user and can't listen to audio, please
check that the user belongs to the <code>audio</code> group. For any other trouble, please
check the full documentation and/or use the forum.
</p>
<p>
Videos can be watched by installing one single package or using a dedicated
LiveCD or LiveUSB system. The SliTaz team have packaged some of the best video players 
available under GNU/Linux: <code>mplayer</code>, <code>xine-ui</code> and <code>vlc</code>.
</p>

<a name="info"></a>
<h3>System information</h3>
<p>
You can get information on your system by clicking on "System information"
in the System Tools menu, then "Summary". Clicking on the other 
buttons offers you more information, and using the benchmarks can
give you an idea on how fast your computer is. To have a list and control
of all your current processes, you can use the "Task Manager".
</p>

<a name="root"></a>
<h3>Becoming Root</h3>
<p>
By default, Slitaz doesn't have its desktop running as root administrator:
it asks for a root password (default <code>root</code>) for any superuser work.
Therefore, it is safer and more secure. To become root in an xterm, simply 
type <code>su</code> and enter the root password.
</p>

<a name="install"></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
SliTaz can be installed to a hard disk or on an USB mass storage device using the
"SliTaz Installer" from the "System Tools" menu. The installer makes a full HD install.
SliTaz won't function in memory (RAM) anymore like in Live or Frugal mode and 
everything is persistent.
</p>
<p>
To generate a LiveUSB system, you can use the "Tazusb LiveUSB Tool" from the "System Tools"
menu or <code>tazusb</code> from the command line. More information can be found in the SliTaz
Handbook: <a href="http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:liveusb">LiveUSB media</a>
